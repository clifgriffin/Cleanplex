# Cleanplex

A home server service that monitors your Plex instance for active streams and automatically skips past inappropriate (nudity/sexual) content for configured user accounts.

## How It Works

### 1. Pre-scan (Background Analysis)
When videos are added to your Plex library, Cleanplex queues them for background analysis:
- Extracts frames from the video every 10 seconds using `ffmpeg`
- Runs each frame through [NudeNet](https://github.com/notAI-tech/NudeNet) (lightweight, CPU-friendly ONNX model running fully locally)
- Each detected scene is **expanded by 5 seconds before and after** to catch any leading/trailing content the detector might have missed
- Flagged frames are clustered into skip segments and stored in a local SQLite database
- A 2-hour movie takes ~20–30 minutes to scan on a Raspberry Pi 4

### 2. Real-time Playback Monitoring
While someone watches, the service polls Plex every few seconds:
- Checks if a filtered user's playback position enters a flagged segment
- The monitor uses a **5-second lookahead** before each segment start to compensate for polling latency
- When triggered, automatically sends a seek command to jump **past the entire segment** (including the 5-second buffers)
- This is just a database lookup — no ML at playback time

### 3. Web UI Dashboard
Full browser interface at `http://your-server:7979` for:
- Configuring Plex connection and scan settings
- Reviewing and editing detected segments
- Monitoring active scans with live progress indicators
- Viewing recent skip events

## Requirements

- Python 3.11+
- `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` installed on the server
- Plex Media Server on the same network
- A Plex authentication token

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nazmolla/Cleanplex.git
cd Cleanplex
```

### 2. Install Python dependencies

```bash
pip install -e .
```

### 3. Build the frontend (optional — required for the web UI)

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run build
cd ..
```

### 4. Run

```bash
python -m cleanplex
```

Open `http://localhost:7979` in your browser and configure your Plex connection in **Settings**.

### 5. Install as a systemd service (Linux)

```bash
sudo cp cleanplex.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now cleanplex
sudo journalctl -u cleanplex -f   # View logs
```

## Configuration

All configuration is done via the **web UI** at `http://your-server:7979/settings`. No config files to edit.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| Plex Server URL | — | e.g. `http://192.168.1.10:32400` |
| Plex Token | — | Your Plex authentication token |
| Poll Interval | 5s | How often to check active streams |
| Confidence Threshold | 0.6 | NudeNet score threshold (0–1). Lower = more sensitive. |
| Pre Buffer | 3000ms | Milliseconds to start the skip *before* a segment, so the flagged content is never briefly shown |
| Post Buffer | 3000ms | Milliseconds to hold past the end of a segment before the filter can re-trigger |
| Profanity Wordlist | built-in | JSON array of words the subtitle scanner mutes. Empty uses the bundled list |
| Skip Event Retention | 90 days | How long skip history is kept before being pruned at startup |
| Scan Window | 23:00–06:00 | Time window when background scanning runs |
| Scanner Workers | 2 | Number of parallel scans (higher = more CPU/memory usage) |
| Automatically scan newly discovered titles | On | When off, Cleanplex adds new titles to the Library but does not queue an ML scan. Sidecar and manual scans still work. |
| Detector Labels | — | Select which nudity types to detect (and skip). Only selected labels trigger skips |
| Content Ratings | — | Only scan and filter titles matching your selected ratings |

## Segment Expansion & Skip Logic

**Default behavior:** When a **nudity** segment is detected (e.g., 30s–60s), Cleanplex automatically:
1. **Widens the segment** by the Pre and Post Buffer settings → 27s–63s at the 3000ms defaults
2. **Monitors with a lookahead** of one poll interval — the filter triggers before the widened start to absorb polling latency
3. **Skips to 63s**, past the full segment and its buffers

Profanity / mute cues keep their authored times plus a 300ms pad. The 3s scene buffers would turn a single word into a multi-second jump.

Polling tightens automatically as a stream approaches a segment, so skips land accurately without
polling Plex hard the rest of the time. Every skip is verified on the next tick: a client that
accepts the command without actually moving is recorded as a failure and re-probed.

### Categories, severity and actions

Segments carry a **category** (nudity, sex, violence, language, drugs, fear, commercial, …), a
**severity** (low/medium/high) and an **action**:

| Action | Behaviour |
|---|---|
| `skip` | Seeks past the segment |
| `mute` | Drops the volume for the segment and restores it after — used for profanity. Clients with no software volume (Apple TV) skip instead |

Each user gets a 0–3 level per category. A segment fires when *level + severity* exceeds 3, so
level 3 filters everything in that category and level 0 filters nothing. Users with no saved
preferences have everything filtered, matching the previous behaviour.

`blank` and `blur` appear in some imported files but are **not supported**: Plex exposes playback
position and volume, not the video stream. Those segments are logged and ignored rather than
misapplied as skips.

## Importing Skip Files

Cleanplex reads skip files produced by other tools. **A title with an imported file is never
ML-scanned**, so this is by far the cheapest way to fill your library.

| Format | Extension | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| VideoSkip | `.skp` | Categories, 1–3 severity, and skip/mute/blank handling. The VideoSkip Exchange has ~563 movies and ~110 series, free and without an account |
| Kodi / MPlayer EDL | `.edl` | `start end action`; 0 cut, 1 mute, 2 scene marker, 3 commercial. Also exported |
| MovieContentFilter | `.mcf` | Spec 1.1.0, ~130 hierarchical categories. Also exported |
| Pasted list | `.txt` | Loose `00:12:30 - 00:13:05 nudity` lines, for lists that have no machine format |

Two ways in:

- **Sidecar** — drop `movie.skp` (or `.mcf` / `.edl`) next to `movie.mkv`. Cleanplex checks it when
  the title is first discovered and before a requested scan. A sidecar replaces old segments and
  skips the ML scan. If more than one sidecar exists, Cleanplex uses `.skp`, then `.mcf`, then `.edl`.
- **Library page** — expand a title and use the import box to upload a file or paste a list.

Imported timings are authored against a specific cut of a film. Cleanplex checks them against the
title's runtime and warns when they do not line up, since an extended edition will throw every
timestamp out.

Plex itself does not read `.edl` files, so EDL/MCF export is for Kodi, Jellyfin and mpv.

## Profanity Filtering

Subtitles are scanned against a configurable wordlist and matching lines become **muted** segments —
no frames, no inference, seconds per title. Matching uses word boundaries with suffix handling, so
"shitting" is caught while "classic" is not.

Because the timings come from one audio track, these segments are tagged with that track's language
and only fire when it is the one playing; a dubbed track is left alone rather than muted in the
wrong places.

Violence, gore, drugs and frightening content have **no local detector** — NudeNet covers nudity
only. Those categories are populated by importing skip files, where humans have already graded them.

## Client Compatibility

The seek command is sent via the Plex Player Control API and works with most modern Plex clients:

| Client | Supported |
|---|---|
| Plex Web | ✅ Fully supported |
| Plex for iOS / Android | ✅ Fully supported |
| Plex HTPC | ✅ Fully supported |
| Plex Media Player (desktop) | ✅ Fully supported |
| Apple TV | ✅ Seek supported. Mute is not — tvOS has no app volume, so those segments are skipped instead |
| Roku | ⚠️ Limited support |
| Some Smart TV apps | ⚠️ Limited support |

The Dashboard shows a **Controllable** badge per stream so you can see which clients support seeking.

**Remote Device Access:** The app proxies Plex images through its own server, so posters and artwork load correctly on remote clients (not just localhost).

## Scanner Queue & Priority

The scanner maintains two independent queues:

- **Normal queue** — Regular background scans of newly added titles, processed in order (FIFO)
- **Force queue** — High-priority scans from "Scan Now" clicks, always processed before normal queue items

When you click **"Scan Now"**:
1. Title is removed from the normal queue (if present) to avoid duplicate processing
2. Added to the force queue with the force-scan flag set in the database
3. A scanner worker picks it up immediately (workers check force queue first)
4. Scans regardless of the configured scan window time restrictions

## Ignored Titles

Titles can be marked as **ignored** to skip them during background scans:
- Ignored titles are still queued but the scanner immediately skips them
- You can still run a "Scan Now" on an ignored title — it will be scanned regardless
- The Library view defaults to hiding ignored titles (toggle with the "Show Ignored" checkbox)

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `CLEANPLEX_DATA` | `~/.cleanplex` | Data directory for DB and thumbnails |
| `CLEANPLEX_PORT` | `7979` | Web UI port |
| `CLEANPLEX_HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Bind address |

## Troubleshooting

**Posters not loading on remote devices?**
- The app automatically proxies all Plex images to work around localhost URL issues. Try hard-refreshing the browser (Ctrl+F5).

**"Scan Now" not prioritizing titles?**
- Run the latest version. Recent fixes ensure force-scanned titles are actually moved to the priority queue.

**Detector labels not filtering correctly?**
- Ensure the labels are selected in Settings → Detector Labels. Previously stored segments are filtered at API response time to respect your current settings.

**Some rated titles still appear in the library?**
- Check Settings → Content Ratings. The filter uses exact matching (e.g., "PG" ≠ "PG-13"). "Unrated" is an explicit checkbox option, not the same as empty rating.
